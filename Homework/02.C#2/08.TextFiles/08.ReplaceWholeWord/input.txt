START is startdedicated to training and mentoring a new generation of scholars and analysts capable of examining questions related to terrorism, counterterrorism and community resilience.

START emphasizes a variety of approaches to education from traditional undergraduate courses at the University of Maryland campus, to fully online synchronous graduate courses, to courses abroad. Educational opportunities exist for all types of learners at the undergraduate and graduate level as well as for the non-degree seeking student or professional. In addition, START seeks to advance homeland security and terrorism-related education at all colleges and universities through teaching tools and funding for course development. 

To expand the reach of START research and education even further, START has created a Massive Open Online Course with the University of Maryland and Coursera. "Understanding Terrorism and the Terrorist Threat" begins Jan. 12, 2015 and concludes Mar. 8, 2015. The course will be open for enrollment through Mar. 8, 2015.

In furtherance of its educational and professional development mission, START invites its students to write about their research experiences with the Consortium. Their work is featured on the START Student Blog.
