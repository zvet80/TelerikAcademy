Problem 11. Programming Languages

Perform a research (e.g. in Google or Wikipedia) and provide a short list with information about the most popular programming languages. How similar are they to C#? How do they differ from C#?
Write in a text file called “programming-languages.txt” at least five languages along with 2-3 sentences about each of them. Use English.


1.C++ 
C++ is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing the facilities for low-level memory manipulation. Its advantage is quick processing and compilation mechanism.

2.Java
The special thing about Java is that this is the first purely object oriented programming language. Java was developed on the principle of WORA i.e. “Write Once Run Anywhere”. This feature adds to the portability of Java. 

3.C#
C# belongs to the Microsoft’s family of programming language. C# is very similar to Java in terms of capabilities. It has been said that C# combines the robustness of C++ with the advanced features of Java. 

4.PHP
PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is one of the most widely used languages used to develop dynamic websites. PHP is a server-side scripting language which means that PHP code is processed on the server and end result is sent to the user of the website in the form of plain HTML.PHP is an open-source language and is easy to learn.

5.JavaScript
JavaScript is a client side programming language that runs inside a client browser and process commands on client computer rather than server which results in decreased load on server and increased application’s execution speed. JavaScript has been designed by Netscape and there is hardly any website that doesn’t make use of JavaScript.
