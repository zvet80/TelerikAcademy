A weak storm entering western Europe from the Atlantic will dive southward and rapidly intensify over Italy from later Wednesday into Thursday.
The storm will bring locally heavy rain and high-elevation snow to Italy while a more widespread snow falls from the Dinaric Alps eastward into Romania.
Flooding will be the biggest concern across Italy with central Italy bearing the brunt of this storm system. Rainfall of 25-75 mm (1-3 inches) will be common with localized amounts over 125 mm (5 inches).
While precipitation will fall mainly as rain across Italy, the higher terrain can expect significant snowfall accumulations. The passes connecting west and eastern Italy could experience near blizzard conditions during the worst of the storm with snowfall heavy enough to potentially close roadways for a time.
